        <p class="bottom-text">
          In late 1896, our founder Scrooge McDuck, moved from his home in the
          Scottish countryside to the Canadian area of Klondike to mine for
          gold. The young and ambitious Scotsman dreamed of becoming rich, and
          Klondike was the place to get started. In the harsh Canadian weather,
          he soon realized he would never survive the winter with his current
          outfit consisting of gaiters, a red frieze coat and a floss hat.
        </p>
        <p class="bottom-text">
          Since he was a man of the 1800s, learning the art of sewing his own
          clothes, was out of the question. Instead, he went down to the pub,
          and drank a bottle of scotch all by himself. When he woke up, beside
          him in the bed, he found a beautiful woman. This was Glittering
          Goldie!
        </p>
        <p class="bottom-text">
          Glittering Goldie was a master seamstress, and soon Scrooge had a
          brand-new outfit. Since mining was hard work, he came up with the idea
          of suppling all the miners with Goldies fantastic clothes, instead of
          breaking his back in the mine. And this was the beginning of
          RainyDays!
